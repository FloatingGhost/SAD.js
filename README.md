#SAD.JS

A revolutionary, reactive sad-face framework for the new web.

Stunningly simple to use, and more useful than JS itself, SAD.JS
aims to put your webpage into the future.

##Usage

First, simply import the tiny, minified JS
```javascript
<script src="sad.min.js"></script>
```

Then, the refresh loop is started.

One easy call to 

```javascript
console.log("I <3 Sad.js");
```

will make magic happen.

##Credits

None. There are none.
